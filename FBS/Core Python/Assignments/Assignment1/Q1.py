#Write a program to calculate the percentage of student based on marks of any 5 subjects.

# Taking input marks for 5 subjects
sub1 = int(input("Enter marks of Subject 1: "))
sub2 = int(input("Enter marks of Subject 2: "))
sub3 = int(input("Enter marks of Subject 3: "))
sub4 = int(input("Enter marks of Subject 4: "))
sub5 = int(input("Enter marks of Subject 5: "))

# Calculate total marks
total = sub1 + sub2 + sub3 + sub4 + sub5

# Calculate percentage (assuming each subject is out of 100)
percentage = (total / 500) * 100

# Display result
print("Total Marks =", total)
print("Percentage =", percentage, "%")

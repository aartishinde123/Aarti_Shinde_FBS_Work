# Write a program to enter base and height of a triangle and find its area.

# Taking input 
base = int(input("Enter base of the triangle: "))
height = int(input("Enter height of the triangle: "))

# Calculating area
area = 0.5 * base * height

# Displaying result
print("Area of the triangle =", area)
